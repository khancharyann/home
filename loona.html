	  <p>LOONA, commonly known as 이달의 소녀 in Korean, is a Korean girl group, that consists of 12 members. Jo Haseul, Vivi (Wong Gaahei), Yves (Ha Sooyoung), Jung Jinsoul, Kim Lip (Kim Jungeun), Chuu (Kim Jiwoo), Jeon Heejin, Kim Hyunjin, Gowon (Park Chaewon), Choerry (Choi Yerim), Olivia Hye (Son Hyejoo), Im Yeojin. The name LOONA came from the beginning consonants in 이달의 소녀, which are ㅇㄷㅇㅅㄴ. When the consonants are rearranged they form the Latin word LOONA (ㄴㅇㅇㄷㅅ), which means moon, and is also known to be a name of a Roman moon goddess.  </p>

	  <p>Every K-pop group has its own fandom, and fandom name. Each of the fandom names have meanings behind them. For example, BTS's fandom name is ARMY. As for LOONA, the fandom name is Orbit. The memebrs said that the fandom is making a path of orbit where LOONA can grow, they also said there's a logical explanation, which is also kind of a pun. The fans "orbit" around their idol, and since the group's name is LOONA (meaning moon), it becomes an astrological joke/pun. </p>

	  
	  <h2 id="LOONAVERSE">What is LOONAVERSE and what is the meaning behind it?</h2>
	<p>Unlike some artists, LOONA creates songs that have mysterious theories behind them. LOONAVERSE is an alternate universe that exists in a place called the mobius strip. The LOONA 1/3 members live on Earth and depict actual females who may be seen on the streets or in schools, as for the Odd Eye Circle, they live between Earth and the Universe, known as Middle earth. In each M/V, there are hints and clues left by BlockBerry Creative (BBC). Many people suspect Olivia Hye of being the main villain of LOONAVERSE as she has killed Vivi out of jealousy, since it's been said that Vivi was always the one who bit the Forbidden apple, and she was punished by getting expelled from Eden, Yves seeing this happen was hurt by the disappearance of Vivi, so she decided to also get expelled from Eden, to reunite with Vivi. When Olivia Hye found out that her friend left her to go after Vivi, she got mad as she couldn't admit her love, that's when she met Heejin, who convinced Olivia not to give up on Yves. She then bites into the apple, and she also gets cast out of Eden. She ends up meeting 3 humans, she has no knowledge of. A villain would usually be overprotective and would run away from them, but fortunately the leader of Odd Eye Circle shows that there's no threat against Olivia. There's also a speculation that Olivia had a task to remove Vivi from Eden, and when she succeeded, it brought up major conflicts against an Odd Eye Circle member, Jinsoul. Jinsoul was the first one to gain the Odd Eye, which led to Olivia being swallowed by Jinsoul. After that happened, Jinsoul got banned from Eden, and everything was reset. Olivia and Vivi, came back to life, and both of them were met up with yyxy. That theory came up from the lyrics of "Egoist". In my opinion, Jinsoul is the main villain because in their newest song PTT, she was the first one to be shown with the Odd Eye, and throughout the M/V, the Odd Eye Circle members' personalities started to change. You can tell they turned from good to evil, because of the lighting, clothes, and lyrics. Till this day, fans don't know the actual meaning behind LOONAVERSE, as the group keeps coming up with more mysterious concepts each time. </p>
